How India-Canada ties descended into a public feud,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-66851144,"['The escalating row over the murder of a Sikh separatist leader has the potential to derail years of close relations between Canada and India, two key strategic partners on security and trade.', 'The rift burst into the open on Monday when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada was investigating ""credible allegations"" about the potential involvement of Indian government agents in the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar in British Columbia in June.', 'India responded furiously - it ""completely rejected"" the allegations, calling them ""absurd"". Both have expelled one of the other\'s diplomats and it\'s unclear how they now pull back from the brink.', 'Just a few months ago, the countries were making progress towards signing a free trade agreement - long in the works - this year. Now, talks are paused and an imminent Canadian trade mission to India postponed.', 'So how did things reach this point?', ""The recent G20 summit hosted by Delhi offered some hints, key among them Mr Trudeau's tense (and short) meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Then he suffered the embarrassment of having to wait in Delhi for two more days before he could leave after his plane developed a technical fault."", 'After the two leaders met there was no mincing of words. Mr Trudeau said Canada would always defend ""freedom of expression"" while acting against hatred.', 'In an uncharacteristically sharp statement, the Indian government said it had ""strong concerns about continuing anti-India activities of extremist elements in Canada"" who it accused of ""promoting secessionism and inciting violence against Indian diplomats"".', ""The reference is to calls by Sikh activists in Canada for Khalistan, or a separate homeland for Sikhs. It's a demand that evokes painful memories for millions in India, especially in northern Punjab state where Sikhs form the majority of the population (outside Punjab, Canada has the highest number of Sikhs in the world)."", 'The demand for Khalistan peaked in India in the 1980s with an armed insurgency later crushed - thousands of people were killed. The movement is not prominent in Punjab now, and all mainstream Indian political parties vocally oppose it.', 'But calls for Khalistan are still loud among some in the Sikh diaspora in countries such as Canada, Australia and the UK. Delhi has reacted sharply to demonstrations for and referendums on Khalistan by Sikh activists in these countries - not illegal there, but a major irritant for India.', 'The issue received wider global attention after three pro-Khalistan activists died in quick succession in different countries earlier this year.', ""Paramjit Singh Panjwar, chief of the Khalistan Commando Force who was designated a terrorist by India, was shot dead in May in Pakistan - his killers haven't been identified yet."", 'In the UK, Avtar Singh Khanda, said to be the head of the Khalistan Liberation Force, died on 15 June in hospital. Khanda had been arrested in March after a demonstration in London where protesters pulled down the Indian flag at the country\'s embassy. But a UK police spokesperson said the death ""was not deemed to be suspicious"".', ""Three days after his death, Nijjar, also designated a terrorist by India, was shot dead outside a Sikh temple in British Columbia - it's this murder that has now led Canada to take a strong public stand against a powerful ally."", 'Relations between the two have survived previous strains - Canada reacted sharply to Indian nuclear tests in 1974 and 1998; India expressed its disappointment in 2005 after two Canadian Sikhs accused of a deadly Air India bombing were acquitted.', 'But otherwise, the two nations have mostly been on good terms, except for the Khalistan issue. They have a lot in common: ""a shared tradition of democracy and pluralism"" and ""a common commitment to a rules-based international system"", as Canada itself puts it.', 'They are both Commonwealth countries and members of the G20 group of leading world economies. Canada, which wants a bigger footprint in Asia, sees India as a counterweight to China.', ""It's not just geopolitics, the countries also have strong trade links."", ""India was Canada's 10th largest trading partner in 2022, with bilateral trade in goods at $11.9bn that year, up 56% from the previous year. They were very close to signing that trade agreement now on the backburner."", ""So there's obviously a lot at stake for both countries."", '""I do think that this is a lesson to us all that there is nothing sacrosanct about India\'s close relationships with Western partners. This is a wake-up call that yes, India is a non-aligned player, it values its relations with the Global South, it definitely values its relations with the West. But that doesn\'t mean that it\'s going to be insulated from the possibility of a major crisis in relations,"" says Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center think-tank in Washington.', 'India\'s foreign minister S Jaishankar said earlier this year that Canada\'s response to Khalistan has been driven by ""vote bank compulsion"", a reference to the support Mr Trudeau\'s Liberal Party gets from Sikhs. Mr Trudeau\'s minority government is also backed by the New Democratic Party (NDP), which is led by Jagmeet Singh, himself a Sikh.', ""It's an assessment many Indian experts agree with."", 'Chintamani Mahapatra, founder of the Kalinga Institute of Indo-Pacific Studies, says that Mr Trudeau\'s statements on the issue of Khalistan are ""divisive"".', '""He ignores the sentiments of the larger Indo-Canadian community, which includes the Canadian Sikhs, and appears biased in favour of the Khalistanis. Would he like external support for Quebec separatists? Of course not,"" he says, adding that the relationship between India and Canada has become more stressful due to Mr Trudeau.', '""In the name of democracy, human rights and freedom of speech, Canada should not jeopardise its relations with other countries.""', 'But Avinash Paliwal, who teaches politics and international studies at SOAS University of London, says the sudden escalation may not be due to just domestic compulsions.', '""If your intelligence agencies have gathered credible information that another country, even if it is an ally, was involved in a covert operation on your soil, you\'re bound to act on that,"" he says, adding that it\'s likely that Mr Trudeau tried to raise the issue through other channels first.', ""According to India's statement, Mr Trudeau did bring up the allegation with Mr Modi but received short shrift."", 'The Canadian PM has received support from other domestic politicians, including main opposition leader Pierre Poilievre. The West has reacted too - the US says it is ""deeply concerned"" by the allegations, while the UK says it is ""in close touch"" with Canada on the issue.', ""Experts say that while Western countries see India as necessary to counter China's influence, there is also growing concern about the direction of Indian politics under Mr Modi - critics say attacks on minorities have risen since his government came to power, and raise other human rights concerns."", 'The developments will also be closely watched by Beijing and Moscow, which will be glad to see a ""fissure between India and the West"", Mr Paliwal says. However, he adds that this wouldn\'t ""derail the strategic story"" or ""make Washington turn its back"" on India.', 'Mr Kugelman says China and Russia will see the confrontation differently.', '""Beijing does not want to see India broaden and deepen relations with like-minded countries keen to push back against China. So in that regard, this may be seen as a strategic benefit for Beijing. Russia may be perfectly happy to see Canada bogged down in this crisis,"" he says.', 'In the short term, though, an India-Canada confrontation will have geopolitical consequences. If Canada continues to issue strong statements and goes on to directly accuse India, it will present a unique challenge to Western governments, specially the UK and Australia.', 'The way the West backed Delhi at the recent G20 summit was a clear indication that it wants India to be a viable counterweight to China.', 'But it will be a strategic headache for them if it comes to a point where they have to choose between India and Canada. So far, the UK, the US and Australia have given calculated statements.', 'But can India and Canada still mend their differences to avoid a geopolitical challenge for the West?', 'Mr Mahapatra says that while the Khalistan issue can affect economic co-operation in the short term, it\'s unlikely to derail long-term ties between the countries. He also cautions against ""extreme steps"", especially from Canada.', '""Expelling a diplomat means you don\'t want a dialogue. Such issues need to be dealt through dialogue and diplomacy, not confrontation,"" he says.']"

And that, Ms Mitra adds, is done by scientists at the command centre who are ""watching the Moon through the rover\'s eyes"".', '""The rover is not automated and its movements are controlled from the command centre which acts on the basis of the pictures it sends.', '""There\'s a slight delay before they reach the command centre because of the circuitous route they take - Pragyaan sends them over to the lander which sends them on to the orbiter to pass them on to Earth.""', ""So, by the time the command reaches the rover, it's a few steps closer to the threat."", ""But the fact that it has managed to navigate safely around two craters shows that it's able to communicate really quickly with the command centre, Ms Mitra adds."", 'The first set of data collected from the lunar topsoil and up to the depth of 10cm (4 inches) below the surface from a probe onboard the Vikram lander showed a sharp difference in temperatures just above and below the surface.', 'While the temperature on the surface was nearly 60C, it plummeted sharply below the surface, dropping to -10C at 80mm (around 3 inches) below the ground.', 'The Moon is known for extreme temperatures - according to Nasa, daytime temperatures near the lunar equator reach a boiling 120C (250F), while night temperatures can plunge to -130C (-208F). And temperatures of -250C (-410F) have been recorded at craters which never receive any sunshine and remain permanently in shadows.', ""But, Ms Mitra says, this wide variation in temperature is significant because it shows that Moon's soil - called lunar regolith - is a very good insulator."", '""This could mean it could be used to build space colonies to keep heat and cold and radiation out. This would make it a natural insulator for habitat,"" she says.', 'It could also be an indicator of the presence of water ice below the surface.', 'When a laser detector mounted on the rover measured the chemicals present on the lunar surface near the south pole, it found a host of chemicals such as aluminium, calcium, iron, chromium, titanium, manganese, silicon and oxygen.', 'But the most important of the findings, scientists say, relate to sulphur. The instrument\'s ""first-ever in-situ - in the original space"" measurement ""unambiguously confirms"" the presence of sulphur, Isro said.', 'Sulphur\'s presence on the Moon has been known from the 1970s, but scientists say the fact that the rover has measured sulphur on the lunar surface itself - and not inside a mineral or as part of a crystal - makes it ""a tremendous accomplishment"".', 'Ms Mitra says the presence of sulphur in the soil is significant on a number of counts.', '""Sulphur comes usually from volcanoes so this will add to our knowledge of how the Moon was formed, how it evolved and its geography.', '""It also indicates the presence of water ice on the lunar surface and since sulphur is a good fertiliser, it\'s good news as it can help grow plants if there\'s habitat on the Moon.""', 'The Vikram lander carries an instrument that measures vibrations emanating from its own studies and experiments as well as those from the rover and its activities.', 'Isro said while the Instrument for Lunar Seismic Activity (Ilsa) had its ear to the ground, it also recorded ""an event, appearing to be a natural one"" and was investigating its source.', 'This event had much larger amplitude which means it was much stronger, Ms Mitra says, adding that there could be several explanations for this.', '""It could be some space debris - such as a meteorite or an asteroid - hitting the surface. Or it could be seismic which would make it the first Moonquake recorded since the 1970s. In that case, this could lead to an explanation of what\'s under the Moon\'s surface and its geography.""', 'When Isro posted on X (formerly Twitter) that a probe on the lander had done the ""first-ever measurements of the near-surface lunar plasma environment"" of the south polar region and found it to be ""relatively sparse"", many wondered what it meant.', 'Ms Mitra explains that plasma refers to the presence of charged particles in the atmosphere which could hinder the radio-wave communication that Chandrayaan-3 is using.', '""The fact that it\'s very sparse or thin is good news as it means it will disrupt the radio communication a lot less.""', 'The last thing the Vikram lander did before being put to bed in early September was what Isro called a ""hop experiment"".', 'The agency said the lander was ""commanded to fire its engines, it rose up by about 40cm [16 inches] and landed at a distance of 30-40cm"".', 'This ""successful experiment"" means the spacecraft could be used in future to bring samples back to the Earth or for human missions, it added.', ""Now, could this short hop mean a giant leap for India's future space plans?"", 'Ms Mitra says the ""hop tested restarting the engine after a lunar landing to make sure it is still operating fine"".', 'It also demonstrated that the craft has the ""capacity for lift-off in a lunar soil environment since so far the testing and real lift-off has only been from Earth"", she adds.', 'BBC News India is now on YouTube.

""So when we want to improve this particular process in this part of the plant, what we need to do is flick on a switch and turn that gene on in that location.""', ""Another example is a gene found in maize that helps the plant carry out what's known as C4 photosynthesis, a particularly efficient form of photosynthesis that's also found in millet; Wild Bioscience has activated it in wheat."", 'The company is working on wheat, soybean and maize, and has achieved increases of more than 20% in seed biomass, with field trials currently under evaluation.

Subtleties of expression control and interaction with genetic background of each variety will make this tricky,"" he says.', 'More technology of business:', 'With work still in the early stages, it remains to be seen how much commercial yields can be improved through changes to photosynthesis.', 'However, Mr Hendron says different techniques could be used in combination to even greater effect.', '""We know these are stackable improvements that can drive further and further increases,"" he says.', 'So there will be other technologies out there - Ripe will be one of them - so we can say both of us are doing this individually, but how much more powerful is this in combination?""']"
